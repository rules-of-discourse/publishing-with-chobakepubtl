# The Format of this Guide
The native format of this tutorial guide is as an interlinked
set of MarkDown documents
distributed via GitHub.

The reasons selected for this format are that (1) that would be the
easiest format in which to create this guide and (2) it is hoped
that in the near future, developents will be made which will
enable __chobakepubtl__ to publish into ebook form documents
which are produced in this manner.
